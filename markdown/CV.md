GIANNI CHIAPPETTA
=================


PRÉCIS
------

Hi. I develop and design beautiful interfaces, intuitive experiences, and smart code.

I love coding and I’m passionate about design; this makes me a great web developer. I believe in things like web standards and best practices. Along with my creativity I bring to the table a solid understanding of the DOM, CSS, HTML and an in-depth knowledge of JavaScript and Ruby.

Occasionally I am known to ride a bike.

INTERESTS
---------

I contribute to the open source community as often as possible. Many of my open source projects and contributions are used by others on a daily basis.  For more information, check out my [Github profile](http://github.com). Oddly enough, I would also consider myself quite the outdoorsman; I do enjoy a good hike. I am passionate about what I do and enjoy virtually every facet of development.
